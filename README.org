#+AUTHOR: Timm Lichte

This README uses [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]].

* About

=helm-khard= uses [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] and [[https://github.com/lucc/khard][Khard]] to access and organize your local address book within Emacs.

Currently the following actions can be performed:
- Insert fields of a contact
- Pretty-print contact
- Edit contact
- Create contact
- Delete contact
- Move/Copy contacts between address books
- Merge contacts
- Attach contact VCF to message
- Copy/Visit VCF of contact
- Import contacts from a VCF
- Call vdirsyncer to sync database

Furthermore, contacts can be injected into mail agents such as [[https://github.com/djcb/mu][mu4e]]. 

* Installation

*Note:* 
- Helm (>= v3.9) and Khard (>= v0.17) must be installed separately. 
- Khard assumes that your contacts are stored in the [[https://vdirsyncer.pimutils.org/en/stable/vdir.html][vdir format]] used by [[https://github.com/pimutils/vdirsyncer][vdirsyncer]]. This essentially means, that each contact file contains exactly one contact in vCard format. 

* Configuration & use

- Support of mu4e
